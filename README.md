classes are apart of object oriented programing

in object oriented programming are how we define what a collection of data


A data base is a collection of fields

Product class for amazon everyting has a title

-title 

-director 

Raiting(string)

-price (decimal)

make  a class in aseperate document

 //fields are variables that are associated with a class object

 //constructors

 //Properties

 
        public string _title; underscore indicates that is a naming convention for a field


        when you open richtextbox it takes up the enitre container it's opened in


        Title:Paprika

        Director satoshi konm

        Raiting :R

        Price: 27.99



        The constructor is used to enforce data used to create an instance of the class

        When mathcing an array with a name you first reference the name of the array in the public partial class 

        Format like so:    Product[] movies = new Product[4];
